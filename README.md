ASSIGNMENT 1: This project implements a simple file-based storage system in Java with an accompanying index file to support fast record lookup using binary search.
Data is written to disk in fixed-size pages, indexed by key, and retrieved efficiently without scanning the entire dataset.
The goal is to demonstrate low-level data storage and indexing concepts, similar to those used internally by database systems.

ASSIGNMENT 2: This project implements a simple disk-based data storage system in Java, where records are stored in files and accessed efficiently using an index file 
and binary search. It demonstrates basic concepts of persistent storage, page-based data organization, and indexed lookup.

ASSIGNMENT 3: This project implements a file-based data storage system in Java that stores records on disk and retrieves them efficiently using an index file and binary search. 
It demonstrates basic concepts of persistent storage and indexed lookup without relying on in-memory data structures.
